Dev reflection prompts:

How did you interpret and implement someone else’s idea?
- The PRD was the biggest part in this - it allowed for clear guidance. The wireframes were also helpful for structure, yet very basic. I interpreted this movie recommender as something that could easily show the best movies in each genre based off of someone else (a movie critic). 
- I immediately thought about Netflix and wanted to add an interesting theme to this that would catch the eyes of someone who enjoys movies. 
- I wanted navigation to be clear and navigable in order to allow the audience or user to get their answers fast. 

What were the challenges in development and collaboration?
- The challenges were fully trying to match the PM's expectations when given a lot of freedom. This is especially tricky because there is a lot of creativity that needs to go into it rather than just following directions. While this does make the project more meaningful and fun, it is hard to 100% meet the expectations of the PM. 

Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?
- All the parts that I used AI for are listed in the code. This includes formatting issues, helping with the design of the website and making it look nice, and some of the technical things like opening a new popup while being on the same page. 
- I learned a lot about how code is stored and can be connected to various parts of the website. I also learned that in terms of visuals and aesthetics, a LOT of code is required to make things look nice and formatted well.
