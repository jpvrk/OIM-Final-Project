# PM Reflection

I came up with this idea while I was eating dinner and could not find a film to watch while I ate. I like to watch movies when I eat and recently, I reached a roadblock, where I cannot find movies that I have not watched. I thought this project would be a great opportunity to solve that issue. 

The collboration with my developer, Justin, was really well as he asked detailed questions and was able to create what I had in mind. He was able to keep me in the loop to tell me what updates he made and when I should go check out v1.0 for feedback. 

While I was writing the requirements, I realized that I needed to be more clear on what I meant when I said I want a movie recommender. I think it could be easily confused that I wanted the recommendation of online users, but I meant the recommendation of the developer. I think in the future I need to be more clear on what I want to make. That being said, I think I made everything else a lot more detailed compared to HW1 as my developer was able to understand what I want without much issue. I did not use any AI for this part of the process.
