# Movie Recommender
The goal of this web page is to recommend movies to the user based on genre and their current mood. 
### Core Features: 
- **Genre based movie recommendations**: Users choose a genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Romance) and the site shows a few movie suggestions from a preset list. Please have 5 genres and the preset list should be movies that you recommend to me and have at least three in each genre category. 
- **Movie card displays**: After a movie is recommended, the recommendations page will show the movie’s poster and title. 
- **Movie Details**: Users can click the posters, which will take them to the movies detail page, where it provides a peronal rating of the film out of 10 as well as a short description of the movie. It can be 1-2 sentences describing the movie and please do not add any spoilers.
